This directory contains some scripts that you need to work happily on
that translation.

Svg.pm: That's a new module for po4a which should deal with inkscape's
        SVG files. It's rather simple and empty for now, but it can
        already ensure that the word's x coordinates of the
        translation are not the same than the original one. That's
        mandatory to avoid buggy inter-letter spaces.
	
	Copy that file into /usr/share/perl5/Locale/Po4a/ and you're set.
	Even better, add a symbolic link from there to the git copy of
        that file.
	
text_merge.inx text_merge.py:
        New extension for inkscape in charge of merging a bunch of
        lines together. That's part of the upcoming release.
	
	Copy those file into /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/ Even
	better, add a symbolic link from there to the git-handled file.
	
	This extension is known to be buggy if you merge texts that
        are not of the same font, size or decoration, so don't do that.
